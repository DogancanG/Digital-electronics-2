A positive voltage should be supplied to the common anode in order to operate
and the common cathode should be grounded. The Cathode(-) side of led's are
connected to a, b , c, d , e, f, g pins of seven segment display in common Anode.
The anode(+) side's of Common Cathode led are connected to a, b , c, d , e, f, g pins
of seven segment display
